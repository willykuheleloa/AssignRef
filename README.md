# AssignRef
### Assign Ref is a platform that allows game official's of the Liga de FÃºtbol Americano Profesional (LFA) to be assigned games, graded based on their performance, tested on their knowledge, and compensated for their work. AssignRef is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code.

My role as a dev was to implement the functionality of the admin dashboard, implement Google Analytics for efficient and cost effective business decisions, and building the contact us page. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.
